# ArduinoChat
Group project with Atakan Saltık, Berk İleri and Öykü Yamakoğlu

This is a term project we did for the Embedded Systems course.
Using the SPI functions of Arduino, we created a chat program where both master and slave can send information. 
For a cleaner look, we implemented it to Java with it's GUI functions and used jSerialComm library for Arduino connection.
